# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Programs must be precise and to the point. Adding extra and unnecessary code can change the outcome and cause errors. In order to maintain, read, and adapt, code must be frequently tested and checked for any mistakes. The advantages of connecting MongoDB to a Python-based interface is the ability to see a visualization of a database. Most people who do not write code for a living will want to be able to type in a keyword and see an image, such as a search engine like Google. The only difference is that databases can be searched and be seen visually, rather than code in a terminal.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
This class differed from other classes because there were many layers to take into account. I originally ran into a port number issue when accessing the interface. This made me go back to the terminal, find the port number through MongoDB, and then implement it into the second layer of Python code. In the future I will remember to backtrack to an earlier stage, even if it was thoroughly tested, to find useful information I may have forgotten about.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists use CRUD to make sure programs are functional. I know in my current field of work, my company could benefit from these skills because of the visualization benefits. Grazioso Salvare can do his work better because he has information easily accessible and represented the way he wants.
